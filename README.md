# Makex-sources

## _The ultimate MakeX source code_

This source code is for testing components from Makeblock for makex competition.

- It works like magic âœ¨
- It has everything you need for your own bots.
- And oh boy we won the championship!

## Features
- Fully automatic program with manually set timings. So things won't go wrong as we know it.
- Diagnostic program. Display every sensor's value for critical mission planning.
- A functioning manual program. With weird keybinds, but hey it works! You can change it to your heart's desire.
- Object oriented programming. For easier debugging and more room for improvements.

## Tech
Makex-sources solely runs on Makeblock's CyberPi or NovaPi programming CPU. A lightweight, powerful programming CPU that can run small to relatively big projects. With a few optimized codes, these source codes will run like a breeze.

## Requirements
Working with Makeblock's parts will require you to have [mblock program](https://mblock.makeblock.com/en-us/) and [python](https://www.python.org) installed on your computer. Otherwise it wont work, really.

## Improvements
There are tons of improvements to be made, but right now we just wanted to sit back and enjoy the current source codes we can distribute to anyone who found this repository helpful and helped you achieve competition's victory. Good luck!
