# Makex-sources

## _The ultimate MakeX competition code. From a contestant_

This source code is for testing components from Makeblock for makex competition.
- And oh boy we won the championship! (Local MakeX competition managed by the university called KMITL)

## Features
- A functioning manual program. With weird keybinds, but hey it works! You can change it to your heart's desire.
- Object oriented programming. For easier debugging and more room for improvements.

## Tech
Makex-sources solely runs on Makeblock's CyberPi or NovaPi programming CPU. A lightweight, powerful programming CPU that can run small to relatively big projects. With a few optimized codes, these source codes will run like a breeze.

## Requirements
Working with Makeblock's parts will require you to have [mblock program](https://mblock.makeblock.com/en-us/) and [python](https://www.python.org) installed on your computer. Otherwise it wont work, really.

## Problems
The source codes for Novapi aren't available in official Makeblock's website. All i did is convert each novapi's function from block coding into a python code. Because i have problems organizing Block code. And i also just dont like writing in block code. So.......... yeah there's python code if you need it!

## Bot behaviors
You can see how our bot behaves by looking at Imagineering MakeX's video. Our MakeX Challenge team called **Hawkeye** and **Doombot**.

## Improvements
There are tons of improvements to be made, but right now we just wanted to sit back and enjoy the current source codes we can distribute to anyone who found this repository helpful and helped you achieve competition's victory. Good luck!
