# Makex-sources

## _The ultimate MakeX source code_

## This repository is depricated, due to wide variety of issues

This source code is for testing components from Makeblock for makex competition.

## Features
- Fully automatic program with manually set timings. So things won't go wrong as we know it.
- Diagnostic program. Display every sensor's value for critical mission planning.
- A functioning manual program. With weird keybinds, but hey it works! You can change it to your heart's desire.
- Object oriented programming. For easier debugging and more room for improvements.

## Tech
Makex-sources solely runs on Makeblock's CyberPi or NovaPi programming CPU. A lightweight, powerful programming CPU that can run small to relatively big projects. With a few optimized codes, these source codes will run like a breeze.

## Requirements
Working with Makeblock's parts will require you to have [mblock program](https://mblock.makeblock.com/en-us/) and [python](https://www.python.org) installed on your computer. Otherwise it won't work.
