# Makex-sources

## _The ultimate MakeX competition code. From a contestant!_

This source code is for testing components from Makeblock for makex competition.
- And oh boy we won the championship! (Local MakeX competition managed by the university called KMITL)

## Features
- A functioning manual program. With weird keybinds, but hey it works! You can change it to your heart's desire.
- 2 competitions off choice! Sadly we dont have our code for **Makex starter** because we havent played with or joined this competition

## Tech
Makex-sources solely runs on Makeblock's CyberPi or NovaPi programming CPU. A lightweight, powerful programming CPU that can run small to relatively big projects. With a few optimized codes, these source codes will run like a breeze.

## Competition details
**These source codes are decent until Makeblock decided to make change to its competition strategy**
- **Makex Explorer**\
Please head to `./cyberpi`. It has a line following automatic program and a complete manual code. Using a catapult system to propel projectiles to opponent's side
- **Makex Challenge**\
Please head to `./novapi`. `Team1` or `Team2` off choice. The codes there are based off our concepts for this competition
## Requirements
- **Cyberpi**\
Working with cyberpi will require you to have [mblock program](https://mblock.makeblock.com/en-us/) and [python](https://www.python.org) installed on your computer (If you are willing to use its python editor). Otherwise it wont work, really.
- **Novapi**\
Working with Makeblock's parts will require you to have [mblock program](https://mblock.makeblock.com/en-us/). And with a pinch of luck because the documentation for Novapi is not enough **if you are willing to not program in block code**

## Problems
* **Novapi**\
The source codes for Novapi aren't available in official Makeblock's website. All i did is convert each novapi's function from block coding into a python code. Because i have problems organizing Block code. And i also just dont like writing in block code. So.......... yeah there's python code if you need it!
* **Cyberpi**\
By the time we had cyberpi on hand we didnt convert from a block code like other teams. We write our own python from their documentation and pypi libraries.

## Bot behaviors
You can see how our bot behaves by looking at Imagineering MakeX's video. Our MakeX Challenge team called **Hawkeye** and **Doombot**.

## Improvements
There are tons of improvements to be made, but right now we just wanted to sit back and enjoy the current source codes we can distribute to anyone who found this repository helpful and helped you achieve competition's victory. Good luck!
